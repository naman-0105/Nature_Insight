                    <p class="news-desc" id="news-desc">Amaryllis (Hippeastrum) are popular indoor winter and holiday plants. The large amaryllis bulbs shoot up long, strappy leaves from their indoor pots and unfurl their giant flowers to give you a splash of midwinter color. Once the flower party is over, you can coax your amaryllis to blossom again the following year. With these tips, you can reinvigorate the bulbs during the summer, let them rest in the fall, and see them flower again in the winter. Amaryllis can rebloom for years if you give them the right TLC. </p>

                    <p class="news-desc" id="news-desc">An easy-to-grow annual with a big garden presence, foxtail amaranth (Amaranthus caudatus) may be tricky to find in garden centers but can be easily grown from seed. It's also known as love-lies-bleeding and tassel flower because of its showy, ropelike flower stalks that appear around midsummer. The flowers hold their color as the panicles of blooms continue growing until frost, extending 12 inches or more toward the ground. </p>

                    <p class="news-desc" id="news-desc">Astilbe is a knockout plant, thanks to its ornamental, fern-like bronze-and-green foliage and its feathery plumed blossoms that look good in season and when dried for winter interest. Even if astilbes never bloomed, the healthy foliage of these plants adds wonderful texture and color to a garden.</p>

                    <p class="news-desc" id="news-desc">The inflated buds of balloon flower (Platycodon grandiflorus) are fun to pop, and they make excellent cut flowers. When using them in a vase, cut them in the bud stage and sear the base of the stems to prevent the milky sap from seeping out and fouling the water. Most commonly available in blue-violet, balloon flowers also come in pink and white.</p>

These colors are often combined in patterns involving blotching and striping, and sometimes, the color changes as the plant ages. Native to Malaysia, the Pacific Islands, and northern Australia, crotons are most often grown as houseplants but can be brought outdoors for the summer. In warm climates, croton can also be planted in the landscape to be enjoyed year-round.
